## 🛠️ Implementation Guidelines

### **TODO-Based Learning Approach**
Each file contains strategically placed TODO comments that guide you through:
1. **Understanding the purpose** of each function/method
2. **Implementing core logic** step by step
3. **Handling edge cases** and error scenarios
4. **Integrating components** effectively

### **Code Quality Standards**
- Follow Python PEP 8 style guidelines
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Include informative logging statements
- Write clear docstrings for all functions
- Use type hints for better code clarity

### **Testing Strategy**
- Test each component individually before integration
- Use small datasets for initial testing
- Verify API connections before processing large batches
- Test edge cases (empty files, network errors, invalid inputs)

## 📊 Data Requirements

### **Expected Data Structure**
The system expects NASA document data organized in folders:
```
data/
├── apollo11/           # Apollo 11 mission documents
│   ├── *.txt          # Text files with mission data
├── apollo13/           # Apollo 13 mission documents
│   ├── *.txt          # Text files with mission data
└── challenger/         # Challenger mission documents
    ├── *.txt          # Text files with mission data
